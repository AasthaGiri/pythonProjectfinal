@201018 Following my breast augmentation, I developed capsular contracture, which caused discomfort and distortion in my results. I was advised to undergo a surgical revision, which was a stressful decision. Iâ€™d like to know how common capsular contracture is after breast surgery and what preventive measures might help.
