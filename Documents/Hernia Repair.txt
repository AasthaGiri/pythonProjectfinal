@201011 Following my hernia repair, I developed chronic pain in the surgical area that has been challenging to manage. Despite following all post-operative instructions, the pain persists, and I find it difficult to engage in activities I once enjoyed. My doctor has tried several treatments, but the results have been mixed. Iâ€™m curious if chronic pain is a common outcome after hernia surgery and what treatment options have been most effective for others.
