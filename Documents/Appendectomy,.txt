@201004 Following my appendectomy, I was relieved to be free of the acute pain I had before the surgery. However, about a week later, I started experiencing severe abdominal cramps and nausea. After several visits to the doctor, it was discovered that I had a bowel obstruction due to adhesions from the surgery. I had to be hospitalized and treated with a nasogastric tube and IV fluids. Iâ€™m interested in understanding how often bowel obstructions occur after appendectomies and if there are any preventive measures I could have taken.
