@201007 Following my gallbladder removal, I thought I would feel relief, but instead, I faced severe nausea and digestive issues that persisted for weeks. I was unable to eat certain foods without feeling ill, which affected my quality of life. The doctors advised me on dietary changes, but it was a frustrating adjustment period. Iâ€™m curious about how common digestive problems are after gallbladder surgery and what others have done to manage these complications effectively.
