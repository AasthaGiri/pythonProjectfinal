@201015 After my liver transplant, I dealt with recurrent abdominal pain and bloating that was distressing. My doctor explained that these symptoms could be related to the immunosuppressive therapy I was on. I’ve been managing them with dietary changes, but I’m curious if these issues are common after liver transplants and what additional approaches others have found effective.
