@201014 After my ACL reconstruction, my recovery took longer than anticipated due to unexpected complications, including significant swelling and stiffness. I diligently attended physical therapy, but I felt discouraged by my progress. Iâ€™d like to learn how common prolonged recovery periods are for ACL surgeries and what strategies others have found helpful in overcoming these challenges.
