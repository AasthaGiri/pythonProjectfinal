@201010 After my thyroidectomy, I faced unexpected weight gain and fatigue that were puzzling. Despite my efforts to eat healthily and stay active, I found it difficult to maintain my weight, and I felt lethargic most days. My doctor mentioned that hormonal changes could be a factor, but Iâ€™m interested in knowing how many others have experienced similar symptoms after thyroid surgery and what effective management strategies they have found.
