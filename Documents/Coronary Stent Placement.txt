@201017 After my coronary stent placement, I experienced restenosis, which was disappointing after feeling positive about my recovery. I had to undergo balloon angioplasty again, which was frustrating. Iâ€™m interested in knowing how often restenosis occurs after stent placement and what lifestyle changes might help prevent it.

Patient: 67-year-old male
Surgery: Coronary stent placement
Complication: Restenosis (artery narrowing)
Treatment: Balloon angioplasty
Outcome: Resolved after 3 months
