@201005 After undergoing cataract surgery, I initially felt satisfied with the improved vision. However, I soon began experiencing inflammation in my eye that led to discomfort and blurry vision. My doctor prescribed steroid eye drops, which seemed to help over time, but it was frustrating to deal with these complications after what was supposed to be a straightforward procedure. Iâ€™d like to know how common eye inflammation is after cataract surgery and if there are strategies to minimize this risk.
