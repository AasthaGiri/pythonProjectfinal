@201003 After my knee replacement surgery, I faced persistent chronic pain and limited mobility. The recovery process felt daunting, and physical therapy sessions were challenging. Despite my efforts, the pain continued, and I found it difficult to perform daily activities. I was prescribed pain management medications, but I still struggled with my range of motion. Iâ€™d like to know how frequently patients experience chronic pain after knee replacements and what therapies or interventions have been most effective for others.
