@201002 Following my heart bypass surgery, I felt great initially, but then I developed a blood clot in my leg, which caused significant swelling and pain. It was alarming, and I was worried about potential complications. The doctors started me on blood thinners and suggested compression therapy, which helped manage the condition. I had to adjust my activity levels and attend regular check-ups to monitor the clot. I'm curious about how often patients experience DVT after heart surgery and what steps can be taken to prevent it in the future.
