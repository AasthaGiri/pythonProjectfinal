@201012 After my mastectomy, I experienced phantom breast pain that was alarming and confusing. I had read about it, but experiencing it firsthand was unsettling. The discomfort affected my emotional well-being as well. I was advised on pain management strategies, but I want to know how common phantom pain is after mastectomy and what approaches others have used to cope with it.
