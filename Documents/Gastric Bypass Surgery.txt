@201016 Following my gastric bypass surgery, I faced challenges with malnutrition that were difficult to navigate. Despite following dietary guidelines, I struggled with maintaining proper nutrient levels, which led to fatigue and other health issues. I’ve been working closely with a nutritionist, but I’d like to know how common malnutrition is after this type of surgery and what strategies others have used to manage it successfully.
