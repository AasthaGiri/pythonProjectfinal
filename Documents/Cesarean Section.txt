@201008 After my cesarean section, I experienced unexpected excessive bleeding, which was alarming. I had to be readmitted to the hospital for monitoring and was treated with a blood transfusion. It was a scary experience, and Iâ€™d like to understand how often excessive bleeding occurs after C-sections and what risk factors might contribute to this complication.
