@201006 Post-hysterectomy, I expected a smooth recovery, but I developed a urinary tract infection (UTI) that was both painful and inconvenient. I experienced frequent urges to urinate and discomfort that made it difficult to focus on my recovery. After being treated with antibiotics, the infection resolved, but it took time for me to feel back to normal. Iâ€™d like to learn more about the prevalence of UTIs after hysterectomy and if there are preventive measures that could help.
