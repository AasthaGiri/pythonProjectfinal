@201009 Following my prostatectomy, I dealt with urinary incontinence that significantly impacted my daily life. I was embarrassed and frustrated, as I had to use pads and make frequent trips to the bathroom. My doctor recommended pelvic floor exercises, which have started to help, but the recovery has been slow. I want to know how common urinary incontinence is after prostate surgery and what others have found helpful in managing this issue.
