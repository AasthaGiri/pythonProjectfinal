@201001 After my hip replacement surgery, I experienced severe pain at the surgical site. Initially, I thought it was normal, but the pain intensified over the first few days. I was prescribed pain medication, but it didn’t seem to help much. Additionally, I noticed swelling and warmth around the area, which concerned me. After a follow-up appointment, the doctor diagnosed me with an infection. They treated it with antibiotics and drained the area, which finally provided some relief. I’m interested in knowing how common infections are after hip replacement and what preventive measures can be taken.
