@201013 Following my spinal fusion surgery, I experienced temporary numbness in my legs that was concerning. While it gradually improved, the sensation was disorienting, and I worried about my recovery. My doctor assured me that such neurological symptoms can occur but were usually temporary. Iâ€™d like to know how often these symptoms appear after spinal surgeries and what factors influence their duration.
