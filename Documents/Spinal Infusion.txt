@201020 Following my spinal fusion, I encountered hardware failure that led to a second surgery. The recovery process felt endless, and I was frustrated with the setbacks. I want to know how often hardware failures occur after spinal surgeries and what factors contribute to them.

Patient: 58-year-old female
